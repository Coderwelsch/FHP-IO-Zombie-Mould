Did you ever thinking about what would happend if a zombie mould forage the a whole country? Here you can see a simulation about a very bad slime mould that infect the population of germany!

# Background
In the second project of Input / Output at the FH Potsdam we exposed with slime moulds. Slime Moulds are very tiny organism with very interesting behaviors. [Learning more about moulds here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slime_mold)

In the first test with these little smart moulds we got a small petri dish and built a small environment to take pictures every hour of them.

I needed 2-3 times to got  some good footage.
This is one of the failed tries. Very aesthetically:

This was shot at the beginning:

And that at the end:

This was the small box to took the pictures with a small raspberry pi and a cam installed on the top:

At this point we had some nice footage to proceed and to process these. In my case i wanted to tell a small story about an failed scientific experiment. In fact that i love apocalyptical stories my smart moulds got angry, mutate and raided the human kind ;)
